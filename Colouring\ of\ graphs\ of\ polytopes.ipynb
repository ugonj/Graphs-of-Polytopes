    "**Hajos' conjecture:** For every $t\\ge 2$, every graph with no $K_{t}$-topological-minor is $(t-1)$-vertex-colourable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the report we consult the available  databases for polytopes (Firsching, n.d.) and (Miyata, Moriyama, and Fukuda n.d.), and established the veracity of   Hajos', and thus of Hadwiger's,   for $d$-polytopes on $n$ vertices for the pairs $(d,n)=(4,6-9),(5,7-9),(6,8-9),(7,9)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Catlin (1979) gave counterexamples to Hajos' conjecture for all $t\\ge 7$. His counterexamples are obtained from line graphs of multicycles whose edges have been replaced with multiple edges. The multigraph $_k{C_{2n+1}}$ is obtained from the cycle $C_{2n+1}$ of length $2n+1$ by replacing each edge $xy$ with $k$ edges joining $x$ to $y$. The <i>line graph</i> of $_k{C_{2n+1}}$ is denoted by $L(_k{C_{2n+1}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G_{3,5}$ denote the graph obtained from $L(_3{C_{5}})$ by deleting two nonadjavent vertices. Catlin showed that the chromatic number of $G_{3,5}$ is 7, while its <i>subdivision number</i>, the largest integer $t$ such that $G_{3,5}$ has $K_t$ as topological minor, is 6. Hence it violates Hajos' conjecture. We show that $G_{3,5}$ is not the graph of a polytope.   \n",

    "In addition, consulting the database of the polytopal simplicial 3-spheres on a small number of vertices (Firsching, n.d.), we answered affirmatively the following question of Thompson question for simple $4$-polytopes a small number of facets, namely 6-9 facets (See Kalai 2014). \n",
